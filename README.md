# QOSF Cohort 5 - Screening Tasks

In order to qualify for [QOSF Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/), we have to submit an assessment/screening task. This repo contains my implementation for that task. I have decided to do the _Task 2 Encoding and Classifier_. I'll try to do other tasks as well after some time, InshaAllah.
